 * You do not have to use JAXB to create XML. You might use GSON if you are more

 * you have a way that better suits your design and capabilities. Don't go down
 * a rathole, however, in order to use something different. This implementation
 * works and will not take much time to modify the EscapeGameInitializer to create
